## How to install docker compose on ubuntu

<pre>
  Prerequisites
To follow this article, you will need:

Access to an Ubuntu 20.04 local machine or development server as a non-root user with sudo privileges. If you’re using a remote server, it’s advisable to have an active firewall installed. To set these up, please refer to our Initial Server Setup Guide for Ubuntu 20.04.
Docker installed on your server or local machine, following Steps 1 and 2 of How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 20.04.
Note: This tutorial will guide you through installing Docker Compose v1, which uses docker-compose. Starting with Docker Compose v2, Docker has migrated towards using the compose CLI plugin command as documented in our latest Ubuntu 22.04 version of this tutorial, and away from the original docker-compose. While the installation differs, in general the actual usage involves dropping the hyphen from docker-compose calls to become docker compose. For full compatibility details, check the official Docker documentation on command compatibility between the new compose and the old docker-compose.

Step 1 — Installing Docker Compose
To make sure you obtain the most updated stable version of Docker Compose, you’ll download this software from its official Github repository.

First, confirm the latest version available in their releases page. At the time of this writing, the most current stable version is 1.29.2.

The following command will download the 1.29.2 release and save the executable file at /usr/local/bin/docker-compose, which will make this software globally accessible as docker-compose:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Next, set the correct permissions so that the docker-compose command is executable:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
To verify that the installation was successful, you can run:

docker-compose --version
You’ll see output similar to this:

Output
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
Docker Compose is now successfully installed on your system. In the next section, you’ll see how to set up a docker-compose.yml file and get a containerized environment up and running with this tool.

Step 2 — Setting Up a docker-compose.yml File
To demonstrate how to set up a docker-compose.yml file and work with Docker Compose, you’ll create a web server environment using the official Nginx image from Docker Hub, the public Docker registry. This containerized environment will serve a single static HTML file.

Start off by creating a new directory in your home folder, and then moving into it:

mkdir ~/compose-demo
cd ~/compose-demo
In this directory, set up an application folder to serve as the document root for your Nginx environment:

mkdir app
Using your preferred text editor, create a new index.html file within the app folder:

nano app/index.html
Place the following content into this file:

~/compose-demo/app/index.html
<code>
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Docker Compose Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kognise/water.css@latest/dist/dark.min.css">
</head>
<body>

    <h1>This is a Docker Compose Demo Page.</h1>
    <p>This content is being served by an Nginx container.</p>

</body>
</html>
</code>
Save and close the file when you’re done. If you are using nano, you can do that by typing CTRL+X, then Y and ENTER to confirm.

Next, create the docker-compose.yml file:

nano docker-compose.yml
Insert the following content in your docker-compose.yml file:

docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/share/nginx/html
The docker-compose.yml file typically starts off with the version definition. This will tell Docker Compose which configuration version you’re using.

You then have the services block, where you set up the services that are part of this environment. In your case, you have a single service called web. This service uses the nginx:alpine image and sets up a port redirection with the ports directive. All requests on port 8000 of the host machine (the system from where you’re running Docker Compose) will be redirected to the web container on port 80, where Nginx will be running.

The volumes directive will create a shared volume between the host machine and the container. This will share the local app folder with the container, and the volume will be located at /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container, which will then overwrite the default document root for Nginx.

Save and close the file.

You have set up a demo page and a docker-compose.yml file to create a containerized web server environment that will serve it. In the next step, you’ll bring this environment up with Docker Compose.

Step 3 — Running Docker Compose
With the docker-compose.yml file in place, you can now execute Docker Compose to bring your environment up. The following command will download the necessary Docker images, create a container for the web service, and run the containerized environment in background mode:

docker-compose up -d
Docker Compose will first look for the defined image on your local system, and if it can’t locate the image it will download the image from Docker Hub. You’ll see output like this:

Output
Creating network "compose-demo_default" with the default driver
Pulling web (nginx:alpine)...
alpine: Pulling from library/nginx
cbdbe7a5bc2a: Pull complete
10c113fb0c77: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:alpine
Creating compose-demo_web_1 ... done
Note: If you run into a permission error regarding the Docker socket, this means you skipped Step 2 of How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 20.04. Going back and completing that step will enable permissions to run docker commands without sudo.

Your environment is now up and running in the background. To verify that the container is active, you can run:

docker-compose ps
This command will show you information about the running containers and their state, as well as any port redirections currently in place:

Output
       Name                     Command               State          Ports        
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compose-demo_web_1   /docker-entrypoint.sh ngin ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp
You can now access the demo application by pointing your browser to either localhost:8000 if you are running this demo on your local machine, or your_server_domain_or_IP:8000 if you are running this demo on a remote server.

You’ll see a page like this:

Docker Compose Demo Page

The shared volume you’ve set up within the docker-compose.yml file keeps your app folder files in sync with the container’s document root. If you make any changes to the index.html file, they will be automatically picked up by the container and thus reflected on your browser when you reload the page.

In the next step, you’ll see how to manage your containerized environment with Docker Compose commands.

Step 4 — Getting Familiar with Docker Compose Commands
You’ve seen how to set up a docker-compose.yml file and bring your environment up with docker-compose up. You’ll now see how to use Docker Compose commands to manage and interact with your containerized environment.

To check the logs produced by your Nginx container, you can use the logs command:

docker-compose logs
You’ll see output similar to this:

Output
Attaching to compose-demo_web_1
web_1  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration

If you want to pause the environment execution without changing the current state of your containers, you can use:

docker-compose pause
Output
Pausing compose-demo_web_1 ... done
To resume execution after issuing a pause:

docker-compose unpause
Output
Unpausing compose-demo_web_1 ... done
The stop command will terminate the container execution, but it won’t destroy any data associated with your containers:

docker-compose stop
Output
Stopping compose-demo_web_1 ... done
If you want to remove the containers, networks, and volumes associated with this containerized environment, use the down command:

docker-compose down
Output
Removing compose-demo_web_1 ... done
Removing network compose-demo_default
Notice that this won’t remove the base image used by Docker Compose to spin up your environment (in your case, nginx:alpine). This way, whenever you bring your environment up again with a docker-compose up, the process will be much faster since the image is already on your system.

In case you want to also remove the base image from your system, you can use:

docker image rm nginx:alpine
Output
Untagged: nginx:alpine
Untagged: nginx@sha256:b89a6ccbda39576ad23fd079978c967cecc6b170db6e7ff8a769bf2259a71912
